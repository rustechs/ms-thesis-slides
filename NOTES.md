TODO: Add photos of me and matt and hartmut and ross trying to figure out what I will do


- Title Slide
	- Clearly I spent the most time on this slide, so just take it all in and be aware that it's all downhill from here
	- So the title is obviously vague
		- I

- Agenda
	- Start with some context for this talk and my thesis
	- Talk about some other things first to break the ice (???)
	- Cover the central themes of this talk
		- Touch on some tangential projects I've been working on
	- Get into some technical stuff
		- Introduce the port-hamiltonian framework, what is it, why it's great, etc...
		- Talk a bit about the notion of causality (or "computational" causality)
		- Impedance matching heuristic
	- port-Hamiltonian framework??
	- Then we'll move on to some more tangible matters
		- Talk about brushless motors
			- modeling, operating limits, thermal manangement
		- Move on to tactile sensing
			- Why it's critical to robust and dexterous robots
			- Some useful contact models
			- Briefly describe some ongoing projects with artificial whiskers and skin
			- A word on robot pain
	- Wrap up with a recap of the key points
	- I'll take questions at the end, to keep things moving along

- Background
	- Want to give some brief background on how I ended up here, giving this particular talk.
	- Important to reflect on my trajectory at this point, in order to understand my motivations for this talk
	- I originally got into 



- Talk Title Etymology
	- The Art of Electronics (Horowitz + Hill) is really an amazing book, covering almost everything in electronics from both a technical + practical perspective
	- Ideally, down the road, I'd like to write a book like this for robotics
