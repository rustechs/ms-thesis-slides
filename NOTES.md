		- I

- Agenda
	- Talk about some other things first to break the ice
	- Cover the central themes of this talk
		- Touch on some tangential projects I've been working on
	- Get into some technical stuff
		- Introduce the port-hamiltonian framework, what is it, why it's great, etc...
		- Talk a bit about the notion of causality (or "computational" causality)
		- Impedance matching heuristic
	- port-Hamiltonian framework??
	- Then we'll move on to some more tangible matters
		- Talk about brushless motors
			- modeling, operating limits, thermal manangement
		- Move on to tactile sensing
			- Why it's critical to robust and dexterous robots
			- Some useful contact models
			- Briefly describe some ongoing projects with artificial whiskers and skin
			- A word on robot pain
	- Wrap up with a recap of the key points
	- I'll take questions at the end, to keep things moving along
